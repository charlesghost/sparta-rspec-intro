#RSpec Project Euler

###Installation instructions

In order to run the specific test files for each problem, make sure you are in the specific folder and then run "rspec" on the terminal

     Granted that you've cloned the repository beforehand, 
     if you want to run "problem_1" you'll do:
     > cd problem_1
     > rspec
     
###Task

The task was to solve the first two problems from Project Euler (Multiples of 3 and Even Fibonacci numbers) By using a TDD (Test Driven Development) approach with Ruby.

Problem 1

     If we list all the natural numbers below 10 
     that are multiples of 3 or  5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. 
     The sum of these multiples is 23.
     Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
     
     
Problem 2

     Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the  
     previous two terms. 
     By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
     1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
     By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence 
     whose values do not exceed four million, 
     find the sum of the even-valued terms.
